# Salvator Mundi

The rendering "xml" scripts are in the "rendering" folder. 

Mitsuba I used to do the rendering is version "0.5.0". Thus, the version number in the "scene" tag in "xml" file is <scene version="0.5.0">. This version number needs modification according to the installed Mitsuba version.
